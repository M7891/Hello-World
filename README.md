# Hello-World
first repository in Github  
-------------------------------
well so far the 10 minutes of Hello-world tutorial is not really great ! I mean for newbies like me who are very specific in tracing steps would have problems with the way the tutorial was documented !
but anyway I will keep trying to follow it and see how it will go , wish it will be clear tutroial and I will benfit from it.
